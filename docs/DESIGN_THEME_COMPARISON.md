## 🌓 Alternative: Dark Theme Option

If you prefer the dramatic dark aesthetic, I've saved a backup at:
`app/(client)/page.dark.tsx.backup`

### When Dark Themes Work Well:
- Entertainment/gaming sites
- Developer tools
- Photo/video editing apps
- Night-time use cases
- Minimal content sites

### When Dark Themes Don't Work Well:
- ❌ E-commerce/marketplace (your use case)
- ❌ Information-heavy sites
- ❌ Sites with lots of photos
- ❌ Forms and data entry
- ❌ Sites requiring long reading sessions

## 🎭 Hybrid Approach (Not Recommended)

**Pros:**
- Dramatic first impression

**Cons:**
- ❌ Jarring visual transition
- ❌ Inconsistent brand experience
- ❌ User confusion about navigation
- ❌ More complex theme management
- ❌ Navbar must handle both contexts
- ❌ Reduced professionalism
